# Changes to horiseon starter code 

## Changed the "title" 

Title is now Horiseon. 

## Index.HTML

I changed many of the "div" elements in the starter code to more semantic friendly elements. such as "section", "nav", "container" and others 

## CSS

Made changes to lines of css using unnecessary resources and commented out the lines of code that we no longer needed. Example of this is on style.css line 89-102.

## Sequential order

Made sure code was as easy to read and in Sequential order.
